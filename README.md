# Power-Quality-Analysis-of-a-Hybrid-Microgrid-based-on-Renewable-Energy-Sources
This is the repository for the paper "Power Quality Analysis of a Hybrid Microgrid based on Renewable Energy Sources" accepted for publication in the journal IEEE Latin America Transactions.

The file "Model_14Bus_Microgrid_paper_Latam.slx" contains the simulink model to reproduce the results obtained in the paper. 
To run it you must have a version of Matlab/Simulink 2018b or higher.

The file "Set_parameters.m" contains the parameters necessary to run the model simulation.

instructions
1. open the .slx model in simulink.
2. open the .m file in Matlab.
3.run set_parameter.m file
4.visualize the results in the measurements block of the .slx model
